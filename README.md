# Anime-Rating-Analyzer-and-Recommender

# Project Overview

The Anime Rating Analyzer and Recommender is a data-driven project designed to analyze anime ratings and provide personalized recommendations. This project leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to understand user preferences and suggest relevant anime titles.

# Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and prepares datasets for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes anime rating trends, distributions, and correlations.

Recommendation System: Provides personalized anime recommendations based on user preferences using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

Visualization: Graphical representations of trends, top-rated anime, and user behavior patterns.

Machine Learning Models: Implements various models for predicting user ratings and recommendations.

# Technologies Used
